%
% This example demonstrates how to implement the _simultaneous localization
% and mapping_ (SLAM) algorithm on collected 3-D lidar sensor data using point
% cloud processing algorithms and pose graph optimization. The goal of this example
% is to estimate the trajectory of the robot and create a 3-D occupancy map of
% the environment from the 3-D lidar point clouds and estimated trajectory.
%
% The demonstrated SLAM algorithm estimates a trajectory using a Normal Distribution
% Transform (NDT) based point cloud registration algorithm and reduces the drift
% using SE3 pose graph optimization using trust-region solver whenever a robot
% revisits a place.
%% Load Data And Set Up Tunable Parameters
% Load the 3-D lidar data collected from a Clearpathâ„¢ Husky robot in a parking
% garage. The lidar data contains a cell array of |_n_|-by-3 matrices, where _n_
% is the number 3-D points in the captured lidar data, and the columns represent
% _xyz_-coordinates associated with each captured point.

pClouds = pc2cell(pcSet);
%% Parameters For Point Cloud Registration Algorithm
% Specify the parameters for estimating the trajectory using the point cloud
% registration algorithm. |maxLidarRange| specifies the maximum range of the 3-D
% laser scanner.

maxLidarRange = 20;
%%
% The point cloud data captured in an indoor environment contains points lying
% on the ground and ceiling planes, which confuses the point cloud registration
% algorithms. Some points are removed from the point cloud with these parameters:
%%
% * |referenceVector| -  Normal to the ground plane.
% * |maxDistance| - Maximum distance for inliers when removing the ground and
% ceiling planes.
% * |maxAngularDistance| - Maximum angle deviation from the reference vector
% when fitting the ground and ceiling planes.

referenceVector = [0 0 1];
maxDistance = 0.5;
maxAngularDistance = 15;
%%
% To improve the efficiency and accuracy of the registration algorithm, the
% point clouds are downsampled using random sampling with a sample ratio specified
% by |randomSampleRatio|.

randomSampleRatio = 0.25;
%%
% |gridStep| specifies the voxel grid sizes used in the NDT registration algorithm.
% A scan is accepted only after the robot moves by a distance greater than |distanceMovedThreshold|.

gridStep = 2.5;
distanceMovedThreshold = 0.3;
%%
% Tune these parameters for your specific robot and environment.
%% Parameters For Loop Closure Estimation Algorithm
% Specify the parameters for the loop closure estimation algorithm. Loop closures
% are only searched within a radius around the current robot location specified
% by |loopClosureSearchRadius|.

loopClosureSearchRadius = 3;
%%
% The loop closure algorithm is based on 2-D submap and scan matching. A submap
% is created after every |nScansPerSubmap| (Number of Scans per submap) accepted
% scans. The loop closure algorithm disregards the most recent |subMapThresh|
% scans while searching for loop candidates.

nScansPerSubmap = 10;
subMapThresh = 50;
%%
% An annular region with _z_-limits specified by |annularRegionLimits| is extracted
% from the point clouds. Points outside these limits on the floor and ceiling
% are removed after the point cloud plane fit algorithms idenfity the region of
% interest.

annularRegionLimits = [-0.75 0.75];
%%
% The maximum acceptable Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) in estimating relative
% pose between loop candidates is specified by |rmseThreshold|. Choose a lower
% value for estimating accurate loop closure edges, which has a high impact on
% pose graph optimization.

rmseThreshold = 0.26;
%%
% The threshold over scan matching score to accept a loop closure is specified
% by |loopClosureThreshold|. Pose Graph Optimization is called after inserting
% |optimizationInterval| loop closure edges into the pose graph.

loopClosureThreshold = 150;
optimizationInterval = 2;
%% Initialize Variables
% Set up a pose graph, occupancy map, and necessary variables.

% 3D Posegraph object for storing estimated relative poses
pGraph = poseGraph3D;
% Default serialized upper-right triangle of 6-by-6 Information Matrix
infoMat = [1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,1];
% Number of loop closure edges added since last pose graph optimization and map refinement
numLoopClosuresSinceLastOptimization = 0;
% True after pose graph optimization until the next scan
mapUpdated = false;
% Equals to 1 if the scan is accepted
scanAccepted = 0;

% 3D Occupancy grid object for creating and visualizing 3D map
mapResolution = 8; % cells per meter
omap = occupancyMap3D(mapResolution);
%%
% Preallocate variables for the processed point clouds, lidar scans, and submaps.
% Create a downsampled set of point clouds for quickly visualizing the map.

pcProcessed = cell(1,length(pClouds));
lidarScans2d = cell(1,length(pClouds));
submaps = cell(1,fix(length(pClouds)/nScansPerSubmap));

pcsToView = cell(1,length(pClouds));
%%
% Create variables for display purposes.

% Set to 1 to visualize created map and posegraph during build process
viewMap = 1;
% Set to 1 to visualize processed point clouds during build process
viewPC = 1;
%%
% Set random seed to guarantee consistent random sampling.

rng(0);

% Initialize figure windows if desired.

% If you want to view the point clouds while processing them sequentially
if viewPC==1
    pplayer = pcplayer([-50 50],[-50 50],[-10 10],'MarkerSize',10);

%% Trajectory Estimation And Refinement Using Pose Graph Optimization
% The trajectory of the robot is a collection of robot poses (location and orientation
% in 3-D space). A robot pose is estimated at every 3-D lidar scan acquisition
% instance using the 3-D lidar SLAM algorithm. The 3-D lidar SLAM algorithm has
% the following steps:
%%
% * Point cloud filtering
% * Point cloud downsampling
% * Point cloud registration
% * Loop closure query
% * Pose graph optimization
%%
% Iteratively process the point clouds to estimate the trajectory.

count = 0; % Counter to track number of scans added
disp('Estimating robot trajectory...');
for i=1:length(pClouds)
    % Read point clouds in sequence
    pc = pClouds{i};
    % Point Cloud Filtering
    % Point cloud filtering is done to extract the region of interest from the acquired
    % scan. In this example, the region of interest is the annular region with ground
    % and ceiling removed.
    %
    % Remove invalid points outside the max range and unnecessary points behind
    % the robot corresponding to the human driver.

    ind = (-maxLidarRange < pc(:,1) & pc(:,1) < maxLidarRange ...
        & -maxLidarRange  < pc(:,2) & pc(:,2) < maxLidarRange ...
        & (abs(pc(:,2))>abs(0.5*pc(:,1)) | pc(:,1)>0));

    %pcl = pointCloud(pc(ind,:));
    pcl = pointCloud(pc);
    %%
    % Remove points on the ground plane.

    [~, ~, outliers] = ...
        pcfitplane(pcl, maxDistance,referenceVector,maxAngularDistance);
    pcl_wogrd = select(pcl,outliers,'OutputSize','full');

    %%
    % Remove points on the ceiling plane.

    [~, ~, outliers] = ...
        pcfitplane(pcl_wogrd,0.2,referenceVector,maxAngularDistance);
    pcl_wogrd = select(pcl_wogrd,outliers,'OutputSize','full');

    % Select points in annular region.

    ind = (pcl_wogrd.Location(:,3)<annularRegionLimits(2))&(pcl_wogrd.Location(:,3)>annularRegionLimits(1));
    pcl_wogrd = select(pcl_wogrd,ind,'OutputSize','full');
    % Point Cloud Downsampling
    % Point cloud downsampling improves the speed and accuracy of the point cloud
    % registration algorithm. Down sampling should be tuned for specific needs.  The
    % random sampling algorithm is chosen empirically from down sampling variants
    % below for the current scenario.

    pcl_wogrd_sampled = pcdownsample(pcl_wogrd,'random',randomSampleRatio);
    pcl_wogrd_sampled = pcl;

    if viewPC==1
        % Visualize down sampled point cloud
        view(pplayer,pcl_wogrd_sampled);
        pause(0.001)
    end

    % Point Cloud Registration
    % Point cloud registration estimates the relative pose (rotation and  translation)
    % between current scan and previous scan. The first scan is always accepted (processed
    % further and stored) but the other scans are only accepted after translating
    % more than the specified threshold. |poseGraph3D| is used to store the estimated
    % accepted relative poses (trajectory).

    if count == 0
        % First can
        tform = [];
        scanAccepted = 1;

                'InitialTransform',prevTform);
        end

        relPose = [tform2trvec(tform.T') tform2quat(tform.T')];

        if sqrt(norm(relPose(1:3))) > distanceMovedThreshold
            addRelativePose(pGraph,relPose);
            scanAccepted = 1;
        else
            scanAccepted = 0;
        end
    end

    % Loop Closure Query
    % Loop closure query determines whether or not the current robot location has
    % previously been visited. The search is performed by matching the current scan
    % with the previous scans within a small radius around the current robot location
    % specified by |loopClosureSearchRadius|. Searching within the small radius is
    % sufficient because of the low-drift in lidar odometry, as searching against
    % all previous scans is time consuming. Loop closure query consists of the following
    % steps:
    %%
    % * Create submaps from |nScansPerSubmap| consecutive scans.
    % * Match the current scan with the submaps within the |loopClosureSearchRadius|.
    % * Accept the matches if the match score is greater than the |loopClosureThreshold|.
    % All the scans representing accepted submap are considered as probable loop candidates.
    % * Estimate the relative pose between probable loop candidates and the current
    % scan. A relative pose is accepted as a loop closure constraint only when the
    % RMSE is less than the |rmseThreshold|.
